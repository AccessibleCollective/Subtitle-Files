An insecure streamer, Infrared or Haz, from political Twitch who is known for homophobia, transphobia, misogyny etc with huge PUA (pick-up artist vibe) tried to call another cis man (Bad Empanada) "incel" then got quote-tweeted with a clip from his own stream with Kyootbot.

Twitter mutes all videos automatically, and video is not inclusive to deaf, hard-of-hearing, late-deafened and people with auditory disorders, so did the subtitle files.
