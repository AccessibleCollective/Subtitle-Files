1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,680
It's Easter, 8 April. I am in Lappoluobal
with the annual deer relocation.

2
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,400
Antti Lantto and his wife Sara Kristine
will lead the way to the South Island.

3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,400
It's a unique opportunity for me to
to experience reindeer herding up close.

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,680
The Sami have been doing
deer moving for hundreds of years.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,120
It's the livelihoods of many here.
But they also compete.

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,320
Who has the fastest reindeer?
Of such things are made world championships.

7
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,360
-Would you show me a deer?
-Yes. There it is.

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,360
-It's long in the legs.
-It is very long in the legs.

9
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,320
And a long body.
A very good skater.

10
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,040
-That's your joke?
-We'll see tomorrow.

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,960
-Your grin hides an idea ...?
-I have expectations for it.

12
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,400
42.4. That's good.
Now there are only 200 meters left.

13
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,720
Tired. 1:24.3.
It was bad.

14
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm not disappointed.
We'll be back next year.

15
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,720
Now they gather more owners'
reindeer in a fence.

16
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,440
Then they separate them, so they
get their own animals -

17
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,920
- then move them towards the coast.

18
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,160
No one's using a lasso.

19
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,920
We have a small are there.
We are running 40-50 animals in the throws.

20
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,960
So we pull them out.
It's much easier than the lasso.

21
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Tom Arild Isaksen will also
be with the deer moving.

22
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,800
He knows what this is about.
And I, yes.

23
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,960
Now Sara Kristine and Antti separated
all the deer.

24
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,480
Now we can start moving.

25
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,720
I am looking forward to this trip.

26
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,200
We have ten days to go
200 km. The feed will determine the pace.

27
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,920
At Kvenvik waits a boat which will
take them to the South Island and summer grazing.

28
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,040
This is the first time I've awakened
with a snowmobile outside the tent.

29
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,200
But now I'm with the Sami people at their
premises to see deer moving.

30
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,000
It's no ordinary visit.

31
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,640
I may have with me what I want, but
keep it at a level I feel comfortable with.

32
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,360
Such as my one-man tent.

33
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,080
I could sleep in their big tent,
but to have a private life ...

34
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:25,080
I sleep very well in
small tents. They're like home.

35
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,920
The Reindeer are spread out, but they
have full control of where the animals are.

36
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,440
-What are you looking for when you camp?
-Location.

37
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,800
That we have control over certain
areas. Will the flock remain, -

38
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,880
- so we can see snowmobiles
and hear the bells.

39
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Then we can go out and see
if we see the crowd.

40
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:06,840
I also run around the whole herd
and see if an animal has gone astray.

41
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,480
It may. But now it's such good
pasture that they hardly leave each other.

42
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,120
-How long are we here?
-Two days. At least.

43
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,520
My name is Sara Kristine Eira Lantto.
Reindeer herding is in my blood.

44
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,080
I was born and raised
in a reindeer-herding family.

45
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:07,440
Girls in a herding family don't have
the first right to run deer.

46
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,240
It was not the intention
that I should take over Dad's operation.

47
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,240
I was lucky to meet Antti.
Now we have our herd instincts.

48
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,160
It's useless to ask the Sami
how many deer are on a plateau ...?

49
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,520
It's like asking you how
much money you have in the bank.

50
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,400
I'll never answer.
You'll never answer me.

51
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,640
To move the reindeer herd over the mountain
may seem quite natural for the Sami.

52
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,040
But fewer and fewer do it that way.
Most people choose trailers.

53
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,600
Many animals are weak after the winter.
And moving costs more energy.

54
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,640
If we do not fit the tempo so that
they have enough food, someone will fall.

55
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,760
It's a delicate balancing act.

56
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,240
I and sleds are not good. Here I'll
just wait for someone to drop by.

57
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,720
It was deep there.

58
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,920
-I did well for low speed.
Over-like slush, minimum gas.

59
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,080
Then you float.
But this goes well.

60
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,250
Oh, thanks!

61
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Moving and biscuits are great.

62
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,400
When I was little
and came here with my papa, -

63
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,400
- I learned to watch the stones,
mountains and the stars at night.

64
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,400
So you know roughly where you are.

65
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Did you notice the stone we drove
past in place? A large stone?

66
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,040
Next time you drive past there,
you'll know which direction you should go.

67
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,200
-You don't use a compass?
-No. It's up in the head.

68
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,400
-What about GPS?
-I had one once.

69
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,400
I used it a few times to make
track. But you know where you are.

70
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,480
I sold it as fast as
I bought it.

71
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,880
Our relocation is
on pure animal premises.

72
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,760
And it's a good crowd at night, moving
us at night. And then we add the hay.

73
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,560
Thus we can determine
how far the animals will go.

74
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:32,360
It's the fourth day in the mountains.
So far, there has been great weather.

75
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,000
Now I did not have to take morning coffee
before there was a real wind.

76
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,840
Convulsions of King Winter. They
tend not to last more than a day.

77
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,640
Hearing what the plans are for the day.

78
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,920
-What do the animals do when it blows?
-Nothing, really.

79
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,520
If there is plenty of grazing.

80
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:16,520
Are you sure it's a dog?
-Yes. It's disturbing 1/4 of the herd.

81
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,560
If you gather the herd,
I'll go after the dog.

82
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,440
A strange dog
has got herself into the crowd.

83
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Stray dogs are a problem in Kautokeino.
One has come in and bothers the herd.

84
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Now they must do something about it.

85
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,400
Females who are pregnant,
may abort. That must be avoided.

86
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, but I don't own the dog.
I'm driving the herd south.

87
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,600
The sheriff asked you release the dogs.
If they chase after animals again-

88
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,880
- should you shoot them?
-It was what the police said.

89
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,840
It's very bad that they do not
come and pick them up.

90
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Tom Arild is taking the dogs down to
the parish, so we don't have to kill them.

91
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,920
We're glad,
but the owner is more so.

92
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,360
Fascinating to see
how the animals find their way themselves.

93
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,840
They knew they were going up the slope.
Antti turned off the snowmobile engine.

94
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,760
Prefers not to push them too hard.

95
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,400
You enjoying yourself now?
-Yeah, it's good.

96
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:48,400
-Reindeer moving is a high point for you?
-Yes. It's really fun.

97
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:55,440
-Why?
-It's probably natural for us.

98
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:04,360
In spring, warm air, sunshine, moving reindeer.
What's better than that? Nothing.

99
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,680
-Secret Water? What's the name?
-I can not tell.

100
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,320
Secret Water is the secret of water.

101
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,560
This is the weapon.
Just a hook and maggot.

102
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,040
-The first one's free.
-Thank you.

103
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,320
Dog food.

104
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,960
It's just not great down here.

105
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,720
Now that's fish.

106
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,400
Now we throw a lasso
and see who is the best.

107
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:06,080
Family and friends have come to
help with the rest of the move.

108
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,280
And then join in with
a camp championship in lasso throwing.

109
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,880
Shoes laced and thoroughly warmed up.

110
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,440
Psyching out his opponents in advance.

111
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,160
Now begins the competition.
Five throws each and no cheating.

112
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,640
Nils Isak begins.

113
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,360
Camp Championship Winner: Mickey-Per?
Number Two: Antti.  And Number Three: Lars.

114
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,640
-Comment?
-Very nice of you.

115
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,280
-Your own efforts?
-Very poor.

116
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,100
(learn to throw a lasso at nrk.no/monsen)

117
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:33,640
We're all pretty tired, so we shall take the
the sled over the mountain, we shall.

118
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,640
-I was back in the crowd the whole time.
-One should not say the name of the mountain?

119
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,400
The elder folk say never to mention
the mountain when you're on it.

120
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,200
-But now we hope it goes well.
-Why should one not say the name?

121
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,600
I don't know. They say it's bad weather
if you talk about the mountain.

122
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,640
You can almost smell the sea.
One of the highlights during the move.

123
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,160
It smells like the deer, too.
They put on more speed.

124
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,400
Which carries them straight to the South Island.

125
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
The boat belonged formerly to the
Norwegian Ministry of Defence.

126
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,400
Now it runs shuttle service
between the mainland and islands.

127
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Very many reindeer herders
along the coast use this boat.

128
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,120
Titanic.

129
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,560
-I'll be back.
-Feeling happy now?

130
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,280
-They all have been injury-free.
-Excellent.

131
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Perfect relocation.
It's not possible to get better.

132
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,600
South Island is Norway's fourth largest island,
a fantastic place for reindeer.

133
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,480
Large areas to move about, safe
calving areas, few natural enemies.

134
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,320
It warms the heart.

135
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,360
They happily flock here for the summer.

136
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,960
In the autumn they will return
back to the mainland.

137
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,580
But that's "years on", as they say.

138
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,880
Now approaching the herd calving
area. They have gone straight for it.

139
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,600
-It was good they arrived.
-Yes, now they are at the calving site.

140
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,440
-It seems that there is bare ground.
-Which is great for calving.

141
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,960
Now you can begin calving.
Now we have arrived.

142
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,100
(next week)

143
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,080
Lars Monsen. Do you hear me?

144
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,880
Might not be completely safe here.

145
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,700
