1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm going to realize a dream
I've had for a long time:

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Living one year in "Nordkalotten", above the
arctic circle of Norway, Sweden & Finland.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Seeking out the most unknown
parts of this wilderness.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Be there when the seasons change.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Travel the whole time. Fish. Hunt.
Experience animals at close range.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,000
That's what really matters to me.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Say goodbye...
A quick kiss...

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Good trip...
Thanks...

9
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,000
It's autumn...

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,100
During the next month I'll backpack from
Kalmankaltio in Finland to Karasjok.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm going to spend a lot of time in
Upper Anarjohka National Park.

12
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,000
It's one of the least known wilderness
areas, but also the most interesting.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
During the trip I will meet a Sami moose
hunting party and stay with them a few days.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The rest of the time I'll be all
alone, just me and my canoe.

15
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Since I'm starting on the Finnish side,
I'll have to carry a lot at first.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,400
The reward is that I get to see parts of
Anarjohka few other people have seen.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:20,400
I've walked a few km on a moraine by this river,
now I'm below where it meets another river.

18
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,700
And I come up on this ridge,
to lookout over the world!

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,120
Here, it's great!

20
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,610
I'll put my equipment here by the river,
and get rest for tomorrow.

21
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,610
It will be great to get my shoes off.

22
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:13,610
One of the extras I carry is a
pair of sneakers as camp shoes.

23
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,410
The little extra weight is worth it.

24
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,410
These boots are waterproof, but that
doesn't help when no water gets out, -

25
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,610
- so these socks are
drenched with sweat.

26
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,610
They are getting greenish.

27
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,410
This smells nice!

28
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,510
Now the pike stay in the pot
and enjoy themselves a bit.

29
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,010
I chose neoprene boots
instead of leather.

30
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:08,510
Because I will mostly be in the canoe, but
expected heavy lifting the first few days.

31
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,610
I have to say - for that job,
they didn't work.

32
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,610
My feet are really beaten up.

33
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:23,610
Last night I laid there two hours
feeling the pain in my feet.

34
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,610
It just hurt and hurt - the support
and sole are not good enough.

35
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,610
These don't work if you carry
more than 30 kilos.

36
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,620
For that, use traditional leather boots.

37
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,920
That's the price I pay
for bad footwear.

38
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,520
I chose the wrong boots.

39
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,920
This is just like a dream!

40
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,520
At the top of the waterway, it's crowded.
Hopefully there's more room downstream.

41
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,520
Right or left side in this rapid?

42
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,520
We just go down the middle...

43
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,020
Come on...

44
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Come on...
Come on...

45
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
That's it...

46
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,430
So great!

47
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,730
We get paid for our toil!

48
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,130
Look at this!

49
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,630
This is what I want -

50
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,930
- to be alone in the wilderness.

51
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,230
Not many get to experience this.

52
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,030
I know how incredibly privileged I am.
I think about that every day.

53
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,330
No doubt this trout is at least one kilo!

54
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,300
Oi!
- that didn't stay put.

55
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,330
The first trout!

56
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,630
Dinner is secured!

57
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,240
You have no idea how great
that trout tastes.

58
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,740
When I eat pike and greyling,
I'm thankful for the food.

59
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,440
But when I eat trout, I'm thankful -

60
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,540
- that I'm not eating greyling and pike!

61
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,540
Here we have a cup of coffee.
It's a good comrade.

62
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,540
Typical spread; liver paté and cheese,
and cheese and liver paté...

63
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,940
Here's kit for the next fire. For the
next camp in case in there's no willow there.

64
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:07,040
Willow's great for starting a fire. Here is
coffee, two hunter's stews and mashed potatoes.

65
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,540
This is my residence. It's a bit small, I think.

66
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:21,040
The tent's under this tarpaulin to keep it dry.
I have enough guy lines to tie to the trees.

67
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,840
I hang my clothes under it, hopefully
near the fire so they can dry.

68
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,750
Moose hunting in Upper Anarjohka National Park
is exotic, and I can't wait to experience it.

69
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:52,350
I'll meet the hunting party at a cabin at Noarvvas.
At this speed I'll arrive tomorrow afternoon, -

70
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,350
- probably before they land by helicopter.

71
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,550
They are flying in.

72
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,350
Look at this,
these are moose footprints.

73
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,750
This is great moose country, but I haven't seen any.
I've just seen tracks, fresh spoor.

74
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:40,950
They are masters at staying away. Even one
man with no dogs in a canoe makes too much noise.

75
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,550
They sneak away.
But they're here...

76
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,650
I'll put up my tent here, even though it's
just 30 metres away from the hut.

77
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,150
It's better to sleep
with fresh air and no snoring.

78
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,320
-Hello! John Isaac.
-Nice!

79
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,160
Hi!
-Anne Risten.

80
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,600
Hi!
Hi! Øystein Flage.

81
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,000
Josef Iver.

82
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,720
-Welcome to Noarvvas! Harald Ingebrigtsen.
-Thank you!

83
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,720
Hi! So nice you are!
You're great!

84
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,000
Upper Anarjohka is a national park, -

85
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,760
- and to avoid wear and tear,
hunters must be flown in.

86
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,400
So there will be a helicopter.

87
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,320
This is not a disadvantage if
you want extra provisions!

88
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,400
There are a lot of goodies.

89
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,560
-Home-baked bread and stuff!
-We're on vacation, so we're on vacation.

90
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,320
Lars, have a seat.
Here's some moose we shot last year.

91
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,000
-Fried and smoked in the Sami way.
-It looks fantastically good.

92
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,080
-Where should I sit?
-Here is a seat for you.

93
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,960
-Next to the old man.
-'Old man', are you?

94
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,880
He's younger than me,
but I call him the old man.

95
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,000
-Lapin Kulta.
-This will taste great! Thanks a lot!

96
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,080
Oi, oi ...

97
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,840
Fantastic morning.
Everyone is waking up and fast.

98
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,000
Not a breath of wind.
It's gray.

99
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,360
You can see moose a bit
better than when it's sunny.

100
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Great Hunter in the group
is no doubt Anne Risten.

101
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,400
Despite the fact that she is only 18
years old, she has shot three moose.

102
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,360
Who takes a little more time,
is Harald Ingebrigtsen.

103
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,000
My name's Harald Ingebrigtsen
and I come from the Big Korsnes.

104
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,960
I've hunted for seven years,
and have not myself shot a moose, -

105
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,000
- but have been involved in
trapping a lot of moose.

106
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,880
Moose hunting is more difficult
in the Upper Anarjohka than many other places.

107
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,640
The terrain here is pretty flat.

108
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,440
Moose have no
narrow canyons or valleys to run in.

109
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,920
Therefore, hunting shapes up differently.
Using binoculars to a great extent.

110
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,120
One scouts for hours
until you find the animals, -

111
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,640
- and then sneak up on one.

112
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,840
Exactly where he,
in a way, controls us.

113
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,040
Now we can use the small gray
dog to get the better of him.

114
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,400
If we go over there with the dog,
we get safely far from them.

115
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,720
Now we are approaching the mound
where John Isaac saw the moose.

116
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Øystein spotted another,
so there are two beasts there.

117
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,640
The dog is now off the grounds.

118
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,640
It could spook the moose to disappear.

119
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,440
I'll follow whoever I think will
shoot the moose. I'll walk with Anne.

120
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,480
Moose is about 400 meters away.

121
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,120
Behind the nearest small forest grove.

122
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,640
One cannot fool them twice.

123
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,440
-How far do you think it is there?
-How far is it?

124
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,040
300 meters.

125
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,080
It is exciting
getting this close to the animals.

126
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,800
Very thrilling.

127
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,360
There go the animals.
They were spooked.

128
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,000
They ran.

129
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,200
That's it. It was impressive
that we got video, anyways.

130
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,080
Now it's been six days of hunting.

131
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,600
We have been near moose
several times, but they were startled.

132
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,960
It is difficult
to approach them.

133
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,960
Hunting has given
little benefit in terms of reach, -

134
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,000
- but now we try a new method.

135
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,160
We will be laid out at night
in the middle of moose terrain.

136
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,680
Then we hope one comes to us tomorrow.

137
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,640
I grew up in a time of few
moose, so I have plenty of patience.

138
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,880
(gunshot)

139
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,320
I have to laugh.

140
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,240
This is day nine of moose hunting.

141
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,200
In the morning both John
Isaac and the dog slept -

142
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,520
- and the moose disappeared and was lost.

143
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,560
Then a moose cow shows up at the hut, -

144
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,160
- where Harald and Josef Iver are.

145
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,560
Harald's making coffee,
Joseph Iver's sitting on the toilet.

146
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,080
So Harald goes out and shoots the moose.

147
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,200
And our group
can only trudge back to the hut.

148
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,040
Congratulations!

149
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,760
-Who was the shooter?
-He's squatting down there.

150
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,520
-Congratulations, Harald!
-I just saw!

151
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,000
An evil tongue said
that Harald was totally scared.

152
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,200
It's been ten years
since you've shot.

153
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,640
It's only seven years, and I have
been involved in killing of moose.

154
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,240
We work as a team,
it's no good just to be selfish.

155
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,560
This time it was my turn.

156
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,600
So I couldn't refuse to shoot!
-It was funny that you got it!

157
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,600
So welcome!

158
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,600
Here is enough to enjoy.

159
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,120
We poor people have it good.

160
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,960
We show off our trophy!
Now the job's done.

161
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,880
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

162
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,240
It was time.
I think you've grown!

163
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,600
What proof is this here?
Can we call it a felling drink?

164
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,000
-So you begrudge me that?
-We must treat you to it.

165
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,600
Should it all be drunk at once?
Then I must draw a breath.

166
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,000
Good as painful death!

167
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,440
20th of September.
First snow.

168
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,880
-See you!
-Have a good trip!

169
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
This has been a
very pleasant stay.

170
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,640
A fantastic nice bunch.

171
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,080
Fine nights with great
fun around the table.

172
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,240
Moose were here also.
Perfect.

173
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,640
But now I have to set
course for Bavttajohka.

174
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,200
I can bear it, -

175
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,280
- for I'll get a fantastic trip
through the heart of the wilds here.

176
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,240
It'll take ten or twelve
days to Karasjok.

177
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,760
First fire using pine.

178
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,880
The sight of the pines that
stand on the hilltop here, -

179
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,120
- was a delight.

180
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Seeing the pines does something to one.
Then the good fire.

181
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,880
It's quite different
than a fire with birch wood.

182
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,920
Bavttajohka and the Anarjohka
are best known for white fish.

183
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,680
There have been a lot of grayling
in the past.

184
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,920
But if you go a little away from the river,
one can find good trout water.

185
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,000
Have you seen such a wonderful fish!

186
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,440
It's beautiful!

187
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,480
A magnificent example of trout.

188
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,640
I will just land it.

189
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,560
Wonderful!

190
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,850
Dinner is secured.
It is certainly red, and fine in the flesh.

191
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,600
I choose not to tell
where this water is flowing.

192
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,200
If too many are caught here,
the whole trout strain could disappear.

193
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,840
Look at the lovely shape.
It's a log!

194
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,000
It's unbelievable!
I'm standing just three meters away.

195
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,040
A kilogram trout is in the process
of digging a pit to spawn.

196
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,840
It goes in circles, just
like a dog going to bed.

197
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,160
And then curls its tail.

198
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,600
Amazing to watch!

199
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,840
It is so wonderful that
I lose the desire to catch them.

200
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,440
I have dinner for today and tomorrow.
I am pleased with that.

200
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,700
(learn to filet fish at nrk.no/monsen)

201
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,000
This tour through Anarjohka
has been a wilderness adventure.

202
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,920
In the morning I paddled
the last bit down to Karasjok.

203
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Thus, the end of
paddling for the year.

204
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,200
At the same time, it's delightful
to think that this is just the beginning.

205
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,680
Winter is just around the corner.

206
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,000
The snow comes, the ice makes its bed.
It is a different world.

207
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,320
I can't wait!

208
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,560
There is only
one thing that remains.

209
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,360
Burning my underpants.

210
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,480
They burn well!

211
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,480
(next week)

212
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,120
Is there anybody home?

213
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,800
That was a huge wolf!

214
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,760
