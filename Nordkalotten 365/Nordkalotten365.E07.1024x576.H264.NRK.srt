1
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,200
I have taken the trip to northern Finland,
to Lemmenjoki National Park.

2
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,520
An area that's unknown to most
Norwegians, but interesting for me.

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,840
Not least because it's such a
large area. 2850 square kilometers.

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,160
I backpack
and pack my dog, Foss.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,920
We will carry with us
all we need for a month.

6
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
Lemmenjoki is divided into two zones.

7
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,080
One's designed for tourism,
the other is nature untouched.

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,040
There are bonfire pits and tents
and marked trails.

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Here you can experience
lots of nice scenery in a short time.

10
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,200
Because at only a few places 
can you light a fire, -

11
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,480
- without wrestling with the wood.
  It's waiting. Firewood.

12
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,240
So you can get to the good boutiques.

13
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,200
This is an exciting way
to organize a national park.

14
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,560
Most of the traffic is controlled in
a small area, the rest is untouched.

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,520
It's so wild I want to experience it.
You have to orient yourself.

16
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
The fishing is probably much better.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Thus it's tempting
for wilderness afficionados like me.

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,320
One can pack everything one needs
for a month. Know the bag -

19
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,680
- but it's livable. To achieve this
  there are some things to think about.

20
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,800
One thing that increases the weight
of the bag for many, is the tent.

21
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,080
My tent weighs 1.1 kg. There are no
rods or stakes to set up.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,200
But it keeps the mosquitoes 
and the rain outside.

23
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,480
During the summer, and in the forest
you need nothing more than this.

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,840
So I have a nylon cover.

25
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,360
The first thing I do when I get
to camp, is to set it up.

26
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,000
Another advantage is that you can put things
out under the tarpaulin.

27
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,400
A sleeping pad weighs 0.5-1 kg.
The cheapest kind weighs 150 g, .

28
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,480
Sleeping bag weighs 700 g.
It's down.

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,920
Not particularly warm, but it doesn't
need to be in the middle of summer.

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:05,240
I have saved 5.6 kg by choosing the right
tent, sleeping bag and sleeping pad.

31
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,040
Here at Ravadasjärvi it's
comfortable and deserted. Beautiful terrain.

32
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,320
Mountainous terrain and woodland
complement each other.

33
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That narrows it.
A nice trout, I'm sure.

34
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,480
I use live bait.
Knew it was over then.

35
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,040
It stopped swimming. So
I gave it 1-2 m, and let it sink.

36
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,240
Fifth or sixth time I
let spinners sink, I took it.

37
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,400
This is a nice trout.

38
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,440
I should be careful.

39
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,360
Not a gram off a kilo.

40
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Is it possible to have it better?

41
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,200
Driving big trout, the smell of
birch-fire in the nose, nice and warm.

42
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:19,640
I'll take my time. It's in such
moments the rest of the world disappears.

43
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,200
This is the answer to why we do
it. Look at the wonderful fish!

44
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,800
Getting tired now.

45
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,920
Two rounds in the pot
to be done with it.

46
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,960
What a lovely fish.
Sitting in one corner.

47
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,320
Look at it, then!

48
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,000
In this small lake.

49
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,680
It's fun to think.
I have with me an electronic scale.

50
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,080
The range is accurate.

51
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,880
It stops at 1705 gram.

52
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,480
Absolutely beautiful fish.

53
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,080
It's more than I can eat
today. I'll eat half.

54
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,880
The other I will dig down into the marsh.

55
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,040
It's pretty cool there.
I'll eat it tomorrow.

56
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,080
He likes to be scratched 
behind the ear more than Foss.

57
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Check out these hills.

58
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,480
10-12 peaks 
up to 600 m.

59
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,040
Beautiful terrain.

60
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,480
Hi! Morning, you.

61
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,840
Now I'll walk over the mountains.
Be back soon.

62
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,960
It's the nature of Lemmenjoki
that draws me here.

63
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,520
But this is also gold mining country -
rather special in Scandinavia.

64
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,920
I shall meet one of the gold miners.

65
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,120
Hello. Is it Mullius?
Hey, it's Lars.

66
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:55,480
The adventure started in Finnish Lapland
in 1868. They found 600 kg of gold.

67
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Many of the largest lumps
are found in Lemmenjoki.

68
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,160
-Does not matter if it rains?
-Bad weather always come from Norway.

69
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,640
Yes, I agree on that.

70
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,000
Mullis would not
use motorized transport.

71
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,120
He goes in with backpack, sled.
Carrying material for the heavy way.

72
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,040
He will stay in shape
and operate on the basic level.

73
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,920
He can pan week after week, until he
takes the cream job: to wash & clean the gold.

74
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,480
It's what drives him.

75
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,760
-Not for large lumps anyway.
-Do you see any gold at all?

76
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,880
Now comes the most
exciting part of the job.

77
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,080
The last sands are delicate,
and then the gold appears.

78
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:17,520
-Sure nothing falls out?
-Yes. Gold is quite heavy.

79
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,440
-Here is something.
-Good. Lots of gold.

80
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,200
It's very smooth.

81
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,320
But we are not so deep down in the earth.
There's more there.

82
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,840
It bodes well
when you get even deeper.

83
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,800
But some can rejoice even more.

84
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:59,080
The eighth largest lump found in Lapland, 
was found in the neighboring field.

85
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,360
That party we will not forget.

86
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,160
Was it you who did it? Congratulations.

87
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,120
And so it was you? Congratulations.
-Pekka.

88
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,920
-Risto.
-Thanks.

89
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:30,120
Is it possible to see that beautiful
nugget? Do you have it in your pocket?

90
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,560
Can I get hold of it?

91
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,320
Okay, thanks, bye!

92
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,000
He's from Norway.

93
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,280
The celebration takes place
at the Finnish goldmining show.

94
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Cheers!

95
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:01,280
Thanks for now.
Continued success. Bye.

96
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,000
Fun party. Now we set our
heading for the deepest, -

97
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,800
- most secluded wilderness here.
  In there, almost untravelled.

98
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,760
Talking about being in their own world.

99
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,640
This is a dream camp.

100
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,120
On the brink of a moraine,
with sandy bottom and light moss.

101
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,880
Close by the pond.
Soon I'll try the fishing rod there.

102
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,120
So we have Vaskojoki a couple hundred
meters down the road. And completely alone.

103
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:11,280
We went straight to an eagle's nest.
It's rare. And inhabited as such.

104
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,680
Probably golden eagle.
They are quiet when approaching.

105
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:24,640
But we heard it from a distance,
so there are no chicks in the nest yet.

106
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,520
Out walking at night?
What have you done with your mom?

107
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,760
Can't hang out on the corner here.

108
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,440
Think we'll send you off.

109
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,560
You can run to your mother.

110
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,680
I'm not your mother.

111
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,040
We'll begin to move
when you get rested a little.

112
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,600
Maybe your mother calls more for you.

113
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
I must get up.

114
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,800
Let's walk 100 m into the forest with you.
Bet that your mother finds you.

115
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,640
starting to eat.

116
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,720
Now we have gone almost twenty kilometers.

117
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,000
I have arrived at Vaskolompolo.
Here there's a hut.

118
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,320
Tomorrow an old
companion of mine visits.

119
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,560
Now we'll see
whether there are fish in the water.

120
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,120
Now I lie in a hut. And here it's
possible more anglers will come.

121
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,920
Then I should not let it fly what
worked well, on the fishing pole.

122
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,720
I have to put on something really bad.

123
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:10,200
When the other fishermen ask what I
hook grayling on, I'll show them that.

124
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,720
So keep
your secrets to yourself.

125
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,960
Morn. In the evening we can
be tempted with boiled grayling.

126
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,160
A kilogram and a half of cleaned fish.

127
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,240
Trond Strømdahl and I
have known each other since 1985.

128
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,560
A better man to have with one
in the field is hard to find.

129
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,800
-Good to see you.
-Been in long?

130
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,440
Seven or eight hours.
Taken at night to help.

131
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:15,400
It's a Lemmenjoki record.
I have something I think you will like.

132
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:27,640
Since you look a little sad,
a bit slim, I brought a little bacon.

133
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,800
Litt.

134
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,600
Then it grayling for you
and bacon for me.

135
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:47,400
-Are there trout you have caught with it?
-Harr. A lot of nice grayling.

136
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,960
Out there? Certainly fun, there.

137
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,480
Is "stupid" on my forehead, too?

138
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,520
-No getting grayling with that.
-Yes, it's an excellent grayling bait.

139
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Fine, you think that. But your lure does not.
It has not had grayling on it.

140
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,960
There are some who know
me better than others ...

141
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,800
Fair that pike took it
when the grayling would not.

142
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,760
40 years ago, there was coffee in it,
North Marka. It was me and my dad.

143
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,680
Now it's with me on tour.

144
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,960
Thanks to my dad and all parents
taking with their young out in the woods.

145
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,800
There he sits, right in the country.
It's huge.

146
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,000
-See the log, then.
-Proper log.

147
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,560
It's larger than the two I have.
Kilo and a half at any rate.

148
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,320
By far the largest grayling I have
had in some time. It's an adult.

149
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,560
All the wilderness gods,
thanks that I get to experience this.

150
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,880
-I let it go a bit.
-You can, safely.

151
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,800
-It may be called grayling chief.
-The boss is in the water.

152
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,960
See the dorsal fin.
See the old man.

153
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,160
I'll check if it sits.

154
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,360
Holy damn! See the grayling.

155
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,880
We're talking log grayling.

156
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,160
Personal minimum before
was 750 g from Ljørdalen.

157
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,120
-Ljørdalen, goodbye.
-Here is the weight.

158
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,000
-This is my eager one.
-You guess 1.6?

159
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,320
It was 1.5.

160
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,560
This was worth the postal route miles.

161
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,480
(Speaking rapid Finnish.)

162
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,000
Lemmenjoki has been an adventure.
Damn shame to leave such a nice area.

163
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,160
We have walked through
true untouched wilderness.

164
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,520
The terrain has been very varied.
Pine and birch forest on top of each other.

165
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:50,400
All camp fires, camp sites ...
This tour has left some track.

166
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:59,400
One thing I can say with certainty:
Lemmenjoki - here I shall return.

166
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
(next week)

167
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,600
Finland is a paradise
for canoers.

168
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,200
Another pike follow
for it on the hook.

169
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,680
Better watch out.
He bites.
