On January 27, 2008, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (or NRK for short) [released Lars Monsen's *Nordkalotten 365*](https://nrkbeta.no/2008/01/27/last-ned-lars-monsens-nordkalotten-365-gratis-og-i-full-kvalitet/) [Norwegian, [English](https://nrkbeta.no/2008/01/29/norwegian-broadcasting-nrk-makes-popular-series-available-drm-free-via-bittorrent/)] via BitTorrent to be freely shared and watched by everyone. The files are no long accessible because the trackers are private (discontinued in 2014) and it has been more than a decade when the series became mainstream on the Internet. 

There used to be a YouTube channel with toggable subtitles for *Nordkalotten 365*, but most likely got copyright-struck for uploading documentaries from BBC. Currently there is one YouTube channel with burned-in (or hard-coded) English subtitles, but the resolution are terrible compared to other uploads available on the platform and texts are difficult to read.

Within the original torrents there were Norwegian same-language subtitles (or closed captions in North American English) [for fan translators](https://nrkbeta.no/2011/06/16/hurtigruten-eng/). Back then, there were numerous contributions in English, German et cetera and NRK Beta [used to post the translations on their website](https://nrkbeta.no/2009/03/08/norwegian-broadcasting-corporation-sets-up-its-own-bittorrent-tracker/). Nowadays one need to use the Wayback Machine to access some of the files if someone actually preserved them on Internet Archive.

The following translated subtitles are from [subs.hopto.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20100211213940/http://subs.hopto.org:80/) [archived]. Translator [lexein-subs@yahoo.com] asked distributed files to be credited via link-back to subs.hopto.org.

> According to NRKbeta on the Nordkalotten 365 page they are using the bittorrent protocol as a low cost distribution method.
> - NRK, through NRKBeta.no, has officially licensed these specific shows for distribution for no-cost download and use. http://nrkbeta.no/bittorrent
> - They went to extra effort to obtain music clearance for digital distribution.
> - They set up their own bittorrent tracker(!) to measure popularity.
> - The TV shows(and music) are still copyrighted, but are licensed for personal use without modification, and with attribution intact. As the copyright holders, they decide what rights to offer. They don't want you to violate their other rights (don't call the material yours, don't sell it, don't edit it, don't use it in in derivative works without permission, etc.).
> - Some material has been released under Creative Commons, such as their lovely HD Bergensbanen train trip footage
> - NRK released Norwegian-language subtitles with specific permission granted to translate and create subtitles in other languages ("fansubs").

> NRK has granted you the rights to download, watch and seed their officially released shows via bittorrent. (Whether a particular country or Internet Service Provider allows you to use bittorrent is another matter entirely.)

NRK does allow everyone to watch the series [on their website](https://tv.nrk.no/serie/et-aar-paa-tur-med-lars-monsen) with Norwegian subtitles. Since the video player uses webVTT, a translation software might do in a pinch.
