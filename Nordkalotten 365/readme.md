On January 27, 2008, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (or NRK for short) [released Lars Monsen's *Nordkalotten 365*](https://nrkbeta.no/2008/01/27/last-ned-lars-monsens-nordkalotten-365-gratis-og-i-full-kvalitet/) [Norwegian, [English](https://nrkbeta.no/2008/01/29/norwegian-broadcasting-nrk-makes-popular-series-available-drm-free-via-bittorrent/)]. The files are no long accessible because the trackers are private and it has been more than a decade when the series became mainstream on the Internet. 

There used to be a YouTube channel with toggable subtitles for *Nordkalotten 365*, but most likely got copyright-struck for uploading documentaries from BBC. Currently there is one YouTube channel with burned-in (or hard-coded) English subtitles, but the resolution are terrible compared to other uploads available on the platform and texts are difficult to read.

Within the original torrents there were Norwegian same-language subtitles (or closed captions in North American English) [for fan translators](https://nrkbeta.no/2011/06/16/hurtigruten-eng/). Back then, there were numerous contributions in English, German et cetera and NRK Beta [used to post the translations on their website](https://nrkbeta.no/2009/03/08/norwegian-broadcasting-corporation-sets-up-its-own-bittorrent-tracker/). Nowadays one need to use the Wayback Machine to access some of the files if someone actually preserved them on Internet Archive.

The following translated subtitles are from [subs.hopto.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20100211213940/http://subs.hopto.org:80/) [archived]. Translator [lexein-subs@yahoo.com] asked distributed files to be credited via link-back.
