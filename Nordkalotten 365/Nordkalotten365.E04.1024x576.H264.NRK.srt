1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,560
It's now 19 January.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,200
It's two months until the
Finnmarksløpet dogsled  race starts.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,920
Now I am on the 
first real training ride.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,520
I started with 16 dogs.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,600
And I went straight into the snow,
so now I'm in a tricky little spot.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,000
16 insane sled dogs.
Ever idiots!

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,920
I lie
with my bone inside the brake.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,240
It can actually break
if they get themselves going now.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,560
I gotta get up
and put away the camera.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,240
I find myself in Alta.

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,520
Soon we'll see the start of Europe's
toughest race for mushers.

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,720
I compete
with 14 highly trained dogs.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,680
My girlfriend, Nina, has trained them
for 5000 kilometers since August.

14
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,880
Now Nina has done that job.
The rest is up to me.

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,960
All who are running
the long Finnmarksløpet race, -

16
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,920
- must have at least two "handlers".

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,200
A handler is a helping person.
I have three.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,120
Nina.
Hans Christian Ørjestad the chauffeur.

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,720
And Frode Galaaen. His job
is to keep me in good spirits.

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,120
Now it's again only 1000 kilometers.
We'll talk at the end of next week.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,760
You must come up with
some hints along the way!

22
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,600
Now we are handling lots of stuff, so
you get to eat at check points.

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,480
-Coffee, bananas ...
And the latest Donald magazine.

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,480
There was so much bacon to choose from.
I bought this "Forest Bacon".

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,560
I looked for "Mountains & Vistas" 
bacon, but they didn't have any.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,520
Two or three minutes to go.
The pressure cooker is lit now.

27
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,160
There is a transition
to come from the tour life -

28
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,200
- and into a competitive situation.

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,480
But I want to try something new.

30
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,880
Tour- and expedition- life
are a safe venue for me.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,360
It's not a competitive situation.
This feeling I like.

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,960
There are five seconds til start!

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,200
Bye!

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,440
Finnmarksløpet
is 1047 kilometer long.

35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
This corresponds to the distance 
from Oslo-Narvik as the crow flies.

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,000
The run has twelve checkpoints
where all participants must stop.

37
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,240
A checkpoint is a place
where the dogs can rest and get care.

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,080
The competition runs for one week.

39
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,560
First person to cross the
finish line at Alta, wins.

40
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,800
Hi, Thomas!
-Hey, Lars!

41
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,600
-You're surging past!
-Do it in the beginning.

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,800
Long Distance Mushing
is a sport.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,440
Many of those who compete
have been doing this for decades.

44
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,640
My goal is ambitious.
I hope to finish in the top ten.

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,640
To others, I say "top 20".
It's to take away some pressure.

46
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,560
When one is overtaken,
one brakes to let the other pass.

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,120
You are on the trip, Lars?

48
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,520
It was Ralph Johannesen,
one of my favorites.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,880
He sailed past in a sitting position.
Familiar style.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,160
We'll give him a trip, we shall!

51
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,080
There are two areas where
I lack experience.

52
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,920
Firstly, it's Nina
who has trained the dogs, -

53
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,720
- so my contact 
  with dogs is not tops.

54
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,080
Second is the checkpoint procedures.

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,440
Most can do
their checkpoint procedures in 25 minutes.

56
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,240
While I'll
fumble around for perhaps an hour.

57
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,760
Thus losing rest 
for the dogs and I.

58
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,520
This is a typical beginner mistake.
I forgot to bring straw.

59
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,040
Similar to sleep in a barn.

60
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,680
We can decide ourselves 
how long to stay at a checkpoint.

61
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,720
How long should one sleep? How far
should one go to exert themselves?

62
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm not going to lie here
too long. One and a half hours.

63
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,960
I do not think 
many are resting so btiefly.

64
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,440
I forgot to sign myself out.

65
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,960
No sport has as much wilderness
in it as long-distance mushing.

66
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,640
That's what draws me
to this sport.

67
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Here you can experience forests,
mountains, streams, wildlife, birdlife -

68
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,240
- while competing.
  It's very fascinating!

69
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,880
Room Service!
Open the door, please!

70
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,680
The plan is that you should run nicely
110 kilometers to Skippagurra.

71
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
Quiet.

72
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:58,680
You have fifteen minutes to eat,
and then you have to work as a whole.

73
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,200
You will be out at 12.37.

74
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,160
I spent five hours and thirteen
minutes at this checkpoint.

75
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,320
The dogs are rested.

76
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,040
I must myself be content with
a half hour's sleep.

77
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,160
Great to run in daylight, guys!

78
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,760
It's nice here!

79
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,240
And it's delicious
to get a track with a decent base.

80
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,080
A dream to see you right now.

81
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,600
But it's far.
110 kilometers to Skippagurra.

82
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,600
Into Skippagurra
I lie in ninth place.

83
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
But it's early in the race.

84
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,560
Behind me are
very many good riders.

85
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,400
They will increase the pace, 
going as fast!

86
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,400
The dogs are the focus. Every one
is checked thoroughly by veterinarians.

87
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,040
If they have an injury,
they are taken out of the race.

88
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,680
A run can be disqualified
for poor dog care.

89
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,360
No dehydration.
That's good.

90
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,880
The veterinarian said in fact these
are the nicest dogs she had seen -

91
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,400
- at this checkpoint.

92
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,720
It's a compliment.

93
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,600
Especially to Nina, who has had
primary responsibility for the dogs.

94
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,080
310 km, nearly a third of the race,
is done.

95
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,080
Checkpoint routines
are much better now.

96
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
So I get
one and a half hours of shuteye.

97
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,120
Good morning, sunshine!

98
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
Have you any appetite?

99
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,680
-I ate one solid meal.
-That was a long time ago.

100
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,600
Now we have lit the primus
with a single match.

101
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,800
Eat and enjoy! You have twelve minutes
until you are out there.

102
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,480
-Bring what's there.
-We are relentless!

103
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Now at five ten. I
will actually turn out at six.

104
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,600
But the dogs are fit. I cut
rest here by half an hour.

105
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,520
Where is it that
I turn to Neiden now?

106
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,720
Just straight ahead?

107
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,840
Shouldn't it 
be sub-zero temperatures here?

108
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,400
-How long will 
you be here?
-Is it normal to say that?

109
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,760
-We want to know.
Isn't it a secret?

110
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
There are more than three hours.

111
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,240
All drivers must have
rest for 16 hours.

112
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,160
One can choose
the checkpoints one does it at.

113
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,240
We chose Neiden.

114
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,160
Five hours of sleep before I go..
isn't it grand!

115
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,200
Sixteen hours
over about twenty minutes.

116
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,800
It has become colder. Fortunately.

117
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,960
We had trouble going yesterday.
Then it was mild.

118
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,280
Now it's hard, fine tracks, but
it's a bit milder throughout the day.

119
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Most people took their 16-hours
rest at Skippagurra or Neiden.

120
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,840
It's only afterwards -

121
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,720
- that we know
  our standings.

122
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,920
As I leave Neiden,
I'm in the top ten.

123
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,720
I'm very pleased!

124
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,200
Now we have to run for nearly seven hours.

125
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,800
This is so nagging.
It's very rhythm of the team.

126
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,160
We have at maximum a few hours left
with this pace.

127
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,480
Now I will speak as little as possible and
just work. I've kicked the whole time.

128
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,840
Now we hang
back on the next driver in front of us.

129
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,600
Now I'll let him see us,
and I'll take a break.

130
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,400
Now he saw me.

131
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,520
But it's dangerous
to be too high in position.

132
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,960
It's a game.

133
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,760
It's easy
to get one in the face in return.

134
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,800
Suddenly stopping the dogs, -

135
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,120
- and then it's you he drives by
  waving you over.

136
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,840
Just be a little humble.

137
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,960
This goes like a greased pig!

138
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,080
You just go and go and do the job.

139
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,600
Now we've run 525 kilometerss.
Over half way.

140
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,440
We have taken our 16-hour break.

141
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,040
The stated objective now
is to be among the twenty best.

142
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,520
It's not quite true.
My goal is "top 10".

143
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,000
Right now it looks very good.

144
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,400
Tactics is a very important word
in long-distance mushing.

145
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,040
It makes it so fascinating.

146
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,080
If I move down to the dogs,
the other drivers will know it.

147
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,440
Frode came up with smart suggestion:

148
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,600
I'm going to dress like him,
fool my way past the team -

149
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,520
- and disappear into the darkness.

150
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,440
It seems that
tactic worked.

151
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,280
I leave Kirkenes
and am still among the top ten.

152
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,520
At the same time I start 
to notice fatique.

153
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,880
And it's due to
very little sleep.

154
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,080
Eleven hours in four days.

155
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Now I'm fairly tired.

156
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,400
They say it's worse in the morning,
and it's true.

157
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,120
Now we have run
in six and a half hours from Kirkenes.

158
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,040
Come on!

159
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,440
Spark Inga has started zombie-kicking.

160
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,920
The legs are moving,
but not always in the right direction.

161
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,520
10:35 it says there.

162
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,360
Ok, when I run, guys.

163
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,680
Bet that there 
is a little speed in the slot.

164
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,360
It seems that
I left Neiden -

165
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,080
- simultaneously with another
  not unknown man.

166
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
Are you going to leave now, Roger?

167
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,320
Yes, I will try to get
in front of him before Lars Monsen.

168
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
It's not difficult.

169
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,280
If there is anyone who deserves
title Mr. Finnmarksløpet, -

170
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,320
- it's Roger Dahl.

171
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,120
He has completed twenty times,
stood on the podium eight times -

172
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,720
- and won twice.

173
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,920
Only once has he broken down.
Then he drove with a chauffeur.

174
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,400
If you manage to hang with Roger,
you are guaranteed a good position.

175
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,120
But he does not wait.

176
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,240
We have to work as a whole
to hang on.

177
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,280
All this goes beyond all expectations.
There is really good punch in the team.

178
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,400
We hang on with Roger!
There, we are actually!

179
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,520
It's incredibly cozy
when approaching a checkpoint.

180
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:59,240
They set up lights and signs.
I feel that we are welcome.

181
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,080
People appreciate
this competition.

182
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,720
It's awesome!

183
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,480
Come on!

184
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,000
Come on!

185
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Welcome!

186
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,440
It was fun to run with Roger here.
But what's Roger doing now?

187
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,640
How long will he rest?
Will he push off again?

188
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,000
Wonder if he
just ran off in the twilight?

189
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,400
As I lay asleep.

190
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,000
It could not lure me away.

191
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes, now it's just Monsen
we must compete against.

192
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,280
-Come on!
-Good luck!

193
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,840
I have
one and a half hours of sleep.

194
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,040
I am running out right in 
front of Roger.

195
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,040
This turns quickly. An hour ago
I was behind Roger Dahl in a fine drive.

196
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Now it's all out.

197
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,400
Now we'll soon be on, guys.

198
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,280
The dogs are very well trained.
This is a psychological reaction.

199
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,480
It could be because I have
for poor contact with them.

200
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,880
I have not been on the sled enough.

201
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:38,400
I must try to get them going again.
It's not far to Sirbma.

202
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,560
Come on!

203
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,320
It took ten minutes.

204
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,840
Good girl! Come on!
Come on, Teddy! Good boy!

205
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,360
I can not talk too much.
Must concentrate on these now.

206
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,200
I got them going again.
Will see if it holds all the way down.

207
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,880
Long Distance Mushing
has ups and downs.

208
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,720
Seven hours of rest is
having a good effect -

209
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,600
- and we kept good pace
  in two stages too.

210
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,960
But then we had a real surprise.

211
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,800
Now there are only 60 km left of
the race, and here they suddenly stopped.

212
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,480
I can only wait.

213
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,880
And so they have to find out when 
they are inspired to move their legs.

214
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,760
Break we do not.
We shall finish.

215
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,000
I know Tore Bergby have won.

216
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,840
Roger Dahl running probably
into an eighth.

217
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,480
And for me it's about getting
to goals, to reach the banquet.

218
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,400
Now we go to Alta.
Are you ready? Ok!

219
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,960
Ok! Come on!

220
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,480
You are an old traveler.
You have run very far.

221
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,440
A short jog is just for fun.

222
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,080
So nice!

223
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,240
This looks good.
You could run!

224
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Come on!

225
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,480
Are you ready? Ok! Come on!

226
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,920
Good boy!
How nice! Here goes away!

227
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,160
There is a positive experience
To see the attitude people have.

228
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,880
Although there is a competition,
they help each other out.

229
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,080
Ok! Yes!

230
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,120
But it means
I arrive at the banquet.

231
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,360
I'll be in goal at No. 25

232
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,200
More than a day
off the best drivers.

233
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,200
It was not exactly what I had
planned, but I have learned a lot.

234
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,680
-Congratulations!
-Thanks!

235
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,320
I have a little gift for you.

236
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,920
You're a tough man.
Colleagues have come to visit.

237
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
Thank you, Frode.

238
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,640
One thing is for sure:

239
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,160
To run the Finnmarksløpet
is a monumental experience of nature.

240
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,560
And such great fun -

241
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,000
- I guarantee
  I will compete again.

242
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,700
(next week)

243
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,480
Now we can start moving.

244
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,090
