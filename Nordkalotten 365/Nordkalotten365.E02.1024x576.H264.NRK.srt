1
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,880
16. October.
I am in Pasvik with Foss, -

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,880
- A 13 month old Alaskan Husky.
Pasvik is bear country.

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,480
I'll meet one of the principal
experts on bears in Scandinavia.

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Perhaps we'll also see
some exciting tracks.

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,720
What's this?

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,680
Interesting. Claw marks on trees.

7
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,800
Looks like a hollow lie.
Nice place to camp.

8
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,760
Do you hear something, boy?

9
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,520
No one is better qualified to talk
about these bear tracks -

10
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,120
- than Steinar Wikan from Pasvik.
Professional about bear tracks.

11
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,600
Good day.
Saw some effects on the environment?

12
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,160
Yes, clawing or biting.
Outstanding!

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,960
One of Wikan's projects is
collecting DNA material.

14
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,280
With that he has proven travel
patterns of 49 bears in Pasvikdalen.

15
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,840
I located where this bear has been.
In the bear pit.

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,320
You show real joy when you
come to a place with bear tracks?

17
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh yeah, there are frequently quite
ordinary things. Manure, bites, etc.

18
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,840
But when you get such a collection,
nesting space, bites and filth, -

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,320
- And perhaps other trace materials,
you get a lot of DNA material.

20
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,040
And you learn a little about bear behavior.

21
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,560
Why have they bitten the trees in the middle
in the summer? Hardly territory marking.

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:16,000
Maybe he was just bored? He
must do something while he is here.

23
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Many thoughts about bear behavior.
And how do bears think?

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,240
- For regular walkers - which
situations can be dangerous?

25
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,480
The most dangerous is
a wounded bear.

26
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,600
A shot or wounded bear
it quite dangerous.

27
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,920
All of the other dangerous situations
are a bit less dangerous.

28
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,880
One other is females with cubs.
We have many such cases.

29
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,240
Sometimes the bears
when confronted are scared.

30
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,240
But we have cases where they
have attacked. Then there are cases -

31
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:22,840
- where someone has a dog with them, which
has pursued a bear at its heels.

32
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,520
We have a few such cases,
where the bear has shown aggression, -

33
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,640
- but without attacking someone.

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,360
It was great to meet you.

35
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Continued success on your
journey in our forests.

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,320
Pasvikdalen is 100-120 kilometers long
and 10-20 kilometers wide.

37
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,400
There's chance of
coming into a bear's presence.

38
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,320
We will start in the north
and go down south walking.

39
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,760
Much of the fun is that we should
be out in October-November.

40
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,960
That keeps most people indoors.

41
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,000
This is a real tour.
I am not here just to chase kilometers.

42
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm here to relax and enjoy
the outdoors as I like to.

43
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,400
To go as far as we feel every day.

44
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,600
Might be staying in the same
place three or four days.

45
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,000
Maybe I'll take a trip
with the gun, fishing rod ...

46
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,320
Foss and I are here to enjoy ourselves.

47
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,400
But is it smart to walk at this time
of year? Should I have skis? Snowshoes?

48
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,640
Will much snow fall?

49
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,560
Wise people say there's usually
little snow before Christmas in Pasvik.

50
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,080
When I choose to trust them.

51
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:41,160
The question is whether I will happen
upon a bear. They aren't hibernating yet.

52
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,480
There are plenty who are out walking.

53
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,560
Good boy.
You must come when I call you.

54
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,400
This snowfall is very nice
When it comes to indicating tracks.

55
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:14,200
But it's a bit scary that
it covers over rockpiles.

56
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,280
It makes it a little hairy.
Have to be careful in the broken rocks.

57
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,720
There are a lot of those in Pasvik.

58
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
Satan in hell!

59
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,720
That's what I meant by not quite
seeing where you put your feet.

60
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,920
Good boy.
Such a good boy!

61
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,320
Is it a good idea to trim his claws?
Oh no.

62
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,480
When it's this cold and clear,
I lie there. Fall asleep by the fire.

63
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,960
Now comes the evening.

64
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,080
20. October.
Last night the ice was not safe.

65
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,840
In the night, it was
nine degrees below zero.

66
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,480
Then I ventured out on the ice
for the first time in years.

67
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,080
(crack)

68
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,080
Don't think I'm going to go far out.
Content myself with water.

69
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,560
It's mine.

70
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,080
Rice porridge is the king in the morning.
Have it Christmas Eve morning.

71
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,320
Of course, it has cinnamon, butter
and a little sugar. Then we are in heaven.

72
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,120
So it was you who stole my fish?

73
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,800
Then there's soup
for supper today also.

74
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:01,000
This is a perfect way to create
a strong bond with your dog.

75
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,680
I selected Foss because he shows
good characteristics for a tracking dog.

76
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,080
I can really get
into his head, -

77
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,240
- we connect very well.

78
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,480
Further on I'll make
him dog in my sled team.

79
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,240
And it's valuable to have a dog
as a guard in the camp.

80
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,040
When there are things around, he hears it.
If a rabbit jumps by -

81
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:48,000
- maybe it ensures dinner.
Reindeer can trample through.

82
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,680
And he's funny.
He's 13 months, young and playful.

83
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,080
A softwood block or log is enough
to get him in a good mood.

84
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,240
Here we come up to water.
It's hard to go on in this terrain.

85
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,760
Tempting to try the ice keeps.

86
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,960
It's worth a try. It will certainly
carry Foss with his claws. But me?

87
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:48,000
It's incredibly easier to walk on ice
than to flounder in the terrain up and down.

88
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,480
Even though one proceeds with cautious
steps, it's much faster.

89
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,400
The stone pile is huge.
Come on. It's much easier on the ice.

90
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,040
Down on the ice.
Come, then, boy.

91
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,520
It's important to not help him when
he tries. He must learn for himself.

92
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:29,440
Otherwise, he will stop all the time
and expect me to help him.

93
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,280
Good boy!
Good boy!

94
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,760
Here we go.
It is better.

95
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,440
A wonderful place to be a hiker.
A night in the open.

96
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,880
Check out the northern lights, hear the fire
crackling. Next night, We spend in there.

97
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,800
Western Hut is one of seven open huts
which is located in Pasvikdalen.

98
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Open to all who want them.
A fantastic offer for hikers.

99
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,880
Indeed, it's just a plain resort.

100
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,920
I just had to out and get some air.

101
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,560
I will be here today. Accomplish
things that are hard to do -

102
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,160
- living in tents or out in the heather.

103
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,520
Is there anyone home here?

104
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,280
Bad set, maybe?

105
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,200
Great to have such things in nature. Provides
an extra dimension to the wandering life, -

106
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,400
- having bears around.

107
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:11,480
The probability that there is a den
within 10 kilometers from here -

108
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:19,520
- with a live bear in it, is great.
Fantastic to have it like that.

109
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,200
The first thing I do when I have picked
a camp, is to stoke the fire.

110
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,440
Delicious smells. That's when you get
up to the camp, then you need fire.

111
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:59,920
When you're usually a little cold and sweaty.
Then just bring up the flames.

112
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,120
These are some of the perks
of being in the pine woods.

113
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,000
In the initial phase, only throw on wood,
so there is a glowing layer the bottom.

114
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:27,880
There is open water below the marsh edge,
even if it's minus 14-15.

115
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,120
We go on a cold enough night for a meeting.

116
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,360
Make sure the lid is back by the fire,
so I do not lose it in powder.

117
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,800
When the fire is lit and the water collected,
it's time to put up the tent.

118
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,520
Then comes the evening.

119
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,520
It's important to slow down,
let your body be a little sluggish.

120
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,960
Don't hustle and fuss. It's okay
that things are going in low gear now.

121
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,000
It important to appreciate the
things you have. A bonfire,  food ...

122
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,200
Now that it's 40 cold, there aren't a
million mosquitoes, the storm's not blowing.

123
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,960
No, life is easy.

124
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,920
(learn to pack dog packs on nrk.no/monsen)

125
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,320
Although it has been cold,
I keep close to land.

126
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,680
There can be thin ice anywhere.

127
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,880
Not bad to arrive at
Ellen Cabin before it got dark.

128
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,640
Only fox and marten tracks on the path,
so it is deserted enough.

129
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,640
Of all the open huts in Pasvik
Ellen's Hut is the most visited.

130
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,440
It's easily accessible, and near
Lake Ellen, which is good for fishing.

131
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,040
And fine water for
paddling in the summer.

132
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,040
There, the sun peeped out.
Was sunny today, too.

133
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,360
Fun you can have with that, too.

134
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,440
Today I walked on Coal Mountain,
260 meters above sea level, -

135
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,720
- the national park's highest point.

136
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
Indeed, it's the weekend, -

137
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,800
- but I'm alone, even at the most
trafficked site in the Upper Pasvik.

138
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,560
Because I'm here in November,
I have all this for myself.

139
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,480
Inconceivable, if you ask me.

140
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:17,520
Something broke some branches there. We're
at the Finnish border, heading south.

141
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,480
It may have been a moose or reindeer.
I doubt that it was something else.

142
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,120
It continues to crack back there.

143
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,240
There are no moose.
So it must be a reindeer.

144
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,280
It can be a bear,
but it seems too cautious.

145
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,320
It was a huge wolf!
Completely black. Anyway very dark.

146
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:41,080
It heard us, and then took off
over there about 80 meters.

147
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,040
The dog is very excited.

148
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,640
Too bad I didn't manage to get it on tape.

149
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,520
Fun to catch a glimpse of the matter.

150
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,680
In the back laboratory.
So I measure out a yard.

151
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,200
We have the foremost laboratory.

152
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,640
It was a real surprise.

153
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,160
Must be running along the oil line
over the marsh.

154
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,840
That's a lot of signs.

155
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,320
When the clock is 11 in Norway, it's
12 in Finland and 13 in Russia.

156
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,920
Nowhere else in
the world is like that.

157
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,240
30 days go quickly
when you're feeling fine.

158
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,240
Being here when the snow falls, and
forest is white for the first time -

159
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,880
- feeling the silence, solitude,
days have become increasingly shorter ...

160
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,360
The Dark Age is just around the corner.
We will be touring throughout the winter.

161
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I felt a lump
of joy in my stomach.

162
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,680
(next week)

163
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,360
The cold is like a lid over the country -
a closet. Been sacked by Santa Claus?

164
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,080
Rumor is that he has switched
to dogs. Is it not Santa Claus?

165
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,760
