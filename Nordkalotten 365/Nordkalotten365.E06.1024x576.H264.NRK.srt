1
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,600
It's May, with a lot of snow in the mountains.
I will explore.

2
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,240
With me, I have Tor Olsen and Nina.
We each have our dogs.

3
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,440
We'll go south on the Swedish side,
but in the wild mountains.

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,120
We do not know where we'll end up,
and it's a wonderful plan to have.

5
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,000
-Is it time to camp?
-Yes, now is the time for it.

6
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:19,200
Now to the fishing,
but there's something we should do first.

7
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,320
-You are missing something in my head, Tor.
-Hair?

8
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not referring to it.
-You are rude!

9
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,480
I thought that I'd wear my cap with
"Northern Scandinavia 365" on it.

10
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,080
-Such a cap would be glorious gift.
-Thank you.

11
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,800
It suits me like a shot. Good!

11
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,100
("FISH THIEF")

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
I could not help myself.

13
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,800
Holy Father!

14
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,720
But I have no fishing license card!

15
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,520
We arranged for licenses for Tor, -

16
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,640
- so now he can fish on 
  with a clear conscience.

17
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,640
It was small then.
Then I lost it, great.

18
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,640
Soon there will be coffee.

19
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,760
It's the third morning,
and snow pounded the tent.

20
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,800
Today, the weather is worse.

21
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,720
No doubt.
Is there any life down at Olsen?

22
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,080
There something wrong at Tor's tent.
I hope it's serious.

23
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,600
What were the problems with the tent?
It looked like you fell.

24
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,680
I was freaking dizzy
and fell on my ass.

25
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,120
I do not know what it is or anything,
So I choose to cancel my trip.

26
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:37,920
I will go down and get it checked.
It need not be serious -

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,600
- but there is not much chance to run
  dogs when I'm so dizzy.

28
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,480
We've done about 10 or 12 tours together.

29
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,200
It's the first time I've seen you sick.
We must take it seriously.

30
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,720
We fear
that Tor has heart problems.

31
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Fortunately, we're only two kilometers 
away from an emergency phone.

32
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,840
It's Lars Monsen.
Do you hear me?

33
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,680
He fell over.
He was dizzy and just fell apart.

34
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,960
He has had problems with his heart,
so it could be the heart.

35
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,160
We need you to pick him up.
Is it a helicopter or snowmobile?

36
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,880
-Can you walk over to the helicopter?
-I have gone a bit back and forth.

37
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,960
So we'll go to Narvik hospital
where they'll examine you properly.

38
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,040
It's sad. Now we turn around,
and Thor's not here anymore.

39
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,320
It's really sad. Tor had
rejoiced, and it was his holiday.

40
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,080
He said it to me
while you called for help, -

41
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,400
- that this was his holiday
  and the annual high point.

42
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,320
When you get out this far,
it's right to call for help.

43
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Don't take any chances. It's sour
at the moment, but one gets over it.

44
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,920
We shall go on more trips.
I can't get rid Olsen so easily.

45
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,640
All is well with Tor.
He is well at home.

46
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,640
An ear injury was detected,
and it affected the balance.

47
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,800
Thanks to the Norwegian Air Ambulance
for the great help.

48
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,880
It's incredible
that one can get help so quickly.

49
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:52,000
We got the dogs down from the mountain,
and Foss and I continued alone.

50
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,400
We'll go south on the Swedish side 
of the border towards Sitasjaure.

51
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,280
So we take one day at a time.

52
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,720
It was a tough march,
but now we are over the watershed.

53
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,680
We have gone up from Alesjaure.
There is no fishing.

54
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,200
Closer to the Norwegian border, there are several
waterways, but it's first in the morning.

55
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,760
Foss and his owner are very tired.
Six hours of hard work in the hills.

56
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,520
So we fire up the primus
and enjoy us some heat.

57
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:45,640
I found one snow-free moraine ridge.
We are up at almost 1000 meters.

58
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,400
Today is a day of rest. It's
windy and snowy towards the Norwegian border.

59
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,120
No need to fight the weather.

60
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,680
I've had a lot of bad weather the
first week, but the mountain is rough.

61
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,320
Nothing needs to happen.
One can be a bit quiet.

62
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,280
Fire up the Primus, write
and take a little walk -

63
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,520
- around the small moraine mound
  I have camped at.

64
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,760
Enjoy the taste of our surrounding
tent. Otherwise, it's full winter.

65
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,440
I'll wait of course for
the fine weather to strike.

66
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,920
Eternal optimist, always.

67
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,800
Now the other team has arrived.
Blue sky, fighting the weather in the mountains.

68
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,280
Passing my old jig holes,
I stop and use them.

69
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,640
The important thing is to get food.
Now I am at Tjarvejaure.

70
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,240
Spring is wonderful in the mountains, but
summer is on its way into the lowlands.

71
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,200
It makes me restless.
It's tempting to fish.

72
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,880
It's illegal to fish here,
and reindeer are calving now.

73
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,960
So I do plan B.

74
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,120
I'll go to the East.
Nina can bring the equipment and a canoe.

75
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,560
I can go on
summer's first adventure.

76
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,760
It's 25 May, and the clock is at 23.30.

77
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,320
The sun has just gone down,
and in three hours it's back.

78
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,600
Now it's long, bright days in the north.

79
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,020
It was delicious real campfire coffee.

79
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,820
(learn to properly light a fire at nrk.no/monsen)

80
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,800
It's strange to think 
of winter now.

81
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,440
No more dog-sledding,
ski, sled and freezing.

82
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,280
Now it's full summer.
Total opposite of the dark period.

83
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,360
Outdoor activity offers perspectives
when you are out all year -

84
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,720
- and experience all the shifts,
  feel it in the body.

85
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,920
Then set the proper price for this.

86
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Sleeping under the open sky
in a half poor sleeping bag.

87
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,960
The dog lies on the ground.
Most are single in the summer.

88
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,400
If one then accept
some smoke in one's eyes.

89
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,520
When it's so bright at night,
it's good with anything over the eyes.

90
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,640
As usual I
tend to be a little like that.

91
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,000
Good night, Foss.

92
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:17,040
What I should do now,
is to fish down Big Luleälv.

93
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm going to Muddus National Park,
I am very curious about it.

94
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,280
Are you ready, Foss?
He has never been in a canoe before.

95
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,600
But he has learned
to carry the pack like a god.

96
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,160
He began to draw a sledge in winter
and draws as a god.

97
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,480
Now you should just
sit in the canoe as a god.

98
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,960
Let's try, Foss.

99
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,640
Such o clever puppy!

100
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,480
Such a good boy!
Lie still.

101
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,320
There you go.
Good boy!

102
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,680
Good boy, you are!
It turned out great.

103
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,160
Here, it was fine. Here I can lie,
and then you can lie on the side.

104
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,840
Views of the river
and a little shelter from the wind. A nice place.

105
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,320
He smells something. It can be
reindeer, and it can be a bear.

106
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,320
It's nice to have a dog,
especially in bear country, like here.

107
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,760
Keeping my eye on him,
I'll always have a little notice.

108
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,880
As I do not sleep deeply.

109
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,200
But now it's summer and bright
and difficult to sleep deeply.

110
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Now the fishing.

111
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Wonderful! This year's first fishing pole,
and it there will be more.

112
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,080
I tethered Foss up along the river
and went to fish a little.

113
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,880
Some rustling in the grass behind me,
and damned if it wasn't snakes.

114
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,800
It's not often
one sees them so far north.

115
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,400
It's fascinating.

116
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:28,000
Im here with short sneakers
and feel a little naked on the ankles.

117
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,640
It's good Foss is bound in the woods.
I wonder if this is a pairing.

118
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,080
In this case, it's a rare sight.

119
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,560
Oi, oi, oi ...
Here we come paddling, -

120
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,080
- and damned if it's not
  a dead moose on the beach.

121
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,520
Had this moose been partially eaten,
I would have hesitated to go into the area, -

122
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,720
- since there could be bear.

123
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:54,520
They can defend a moose cadaver as well,
so I have to hang back a bit.

124
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,800
It's not eaten by the bear yet.

125
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,080
It's just a matter of time
before Bamsefar discovers the carcass.

126
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,720
It's hard to say
what it died of. It's full.

127
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,200
It's good to see these things too.

128
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,200
Although it's a dead animal,
it's a natural sight.

129
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,720
In the wilderness you will find animals
who have suffered a natural death -

130
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,600
- as has this one.

131
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,680
Are you going to be with us
moose hunting in the fall?

132
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,920
I've been curious 
about Muddus for years.

133
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,560
Virgin forests, bird life, wildlife ...
It's very rich.

134
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,040
Unfortunately, dogs are not allowed.
Foss must stay at home then.

135
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,440
Foss is so used to tour living
that he knows that I'll come back.

136
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,040
We started the training
in Pasvik.

137
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:23,520
Now there's excitement in my stomach,
for I know that there are bears here.

138
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,400
The path is covered
from the start.

139
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,400
It's a typical Swedish thing.
It's pleasant to walk on Kloppene.

140
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,440
And it saves nature the wear and tear,
no doubt about it.

141
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,920
After a couple of hours
I arrived at Muddus-fall.

142
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,760
A few meters away I see the falls.
I must have have heard them far away.

143
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:04,320
Imagine being trout in free fall
down there. It must tickle the eggs!

144
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,080
Half of Muddus is virgin forest,
and half is wetland.

145
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,000
You feel like you're all alone,
especially now in the early summer.

146
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,160
The mood is now
indescribably beautiful.

147
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,640
The terrain in Muddus is easily passed,
aside from the marshes.

148
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,320
It's wonderful at this time.

149
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,920
It's the last day of May,
and spring is on the wane.

150
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It seethes with life in the forest.

151
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,640
It's so hot during the day
I travel at night.

152
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,040
The atmosphere is fantastically fine.

153
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,480
Chances rise for
encounters with wild animals.

154
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:19,440
Yes! I saw a Muddus-bear.
I had not imagined.

155
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:28,360
It's one ten at night.
Now it's out walking.

156
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,800
The sun rests only in the middle of the day.

157
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,120
It was a real journey out, then!

158
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:47,080
It was a brilliant end of a
detour to Muddus National Park.

159
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,400
Here I shall return.
Such things are fun, especially here.

160
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,000
This is typical bear forest.
It's clear there are bears here.

161
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,400
When their reaction is like that,
it's just fun.

162
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,840
People have little to fear,
for that meeting was typical.

163
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,320
Most bears are afraid.

164
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,440
Wow, I've seen a bear.
It's fun. Fun!

165
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,240
Thank you for that,
you showed up for a few seconds.

166
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,480
It was not bad, this.
Good size for it.

167
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,680
This, then?
It sat there, also.

168
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,240
It's clumsy with two rods
at the same time, but I ask the about it.

169
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,720
There are two pike.

170
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,560
Oi, oi, oi!
It was close. Vanished like smoke.

171
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,040
The fish are in the boat
with wobblers in the mouth.

172
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,440
Oi, oi, oi ...
It was noon today, too.

173
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,040
Such a good boy!

174
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,120
This is a great time for tours.
Summer parties seized.

175
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,760
It becomes more and more lively.
Birds sing, the fish bite ...

176
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:33,320
The idea of swinging a fishing rod every day
of the summer is a fantastic delight.

177
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,520
Now we are talking fish.
Lake perch, that is.

178
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,000
This is a kick in the head. Four or five
provide an excellent dinner.

179
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,960
Number two.
Number three.

180
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,080
They are not fighting much,
since the food is potato chips

181
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,640
Number four.

182
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,400
It's not mashed potatoes for dinner tonight.

183
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,300
(next week)

184
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,600
Look at it, then!

185
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,400
There was lots of gold.

186
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,680
Is it possible
to see the beautiful nugget?

187
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,690
