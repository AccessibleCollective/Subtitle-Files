1
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
There is my
first fish from Lake Inari.

2
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,640
I am excited to see
what kind of fish this is.

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,200
It was char, Foss.

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,520
Finland is
a paradise for canoers.

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,560
"The thousand lakes" has
 more than 60,000 lakes.

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,400
Inari is the third largest.

7
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,280
I'll paddle a week to Lake Inari,
and on to Vatsari.

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
It's
exciting wilderness for Norwegians.

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,960
From there I'll go over the Norwegian border,
to Munk down river and into the Arctic Ocean.

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,800
Now let's enjoy ourselves.
30 days to the end, Foss.

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,880
Here we camp.
Does it pass?

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,160
30 meters long
and between 5 and 20 meters wide.

13
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,880
It's nice to camp on an island.

14
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,600
I can forget Foss
without worrying that he's gone.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,320
He doesn't like to swim.
But I carry the canoe well on land.

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:18,200
The road's 20 km up the waterway.
The canoe won't operate that way.

17
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
In a canoe I can
take with me a lot of luxury.

18
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,000
Such as a gas burner.
And I have the big model.

19
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Then Foss and I can spread out.
One appreciates having plenty of space.

20
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,200
Also I have this.
A habit I brought with me.

21
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,720
It's a bit unusual to carry 
around, especially for a 45-year-old.

22
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:40,000
But it's great luxury
to only be able to ...

23
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,960
... stretch out on a child mattress.
There are issues, there!

24
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There you go.

25
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,960
This can be the first kilogram 
over the border on this trip.

26
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,520
Wonderful!
It's not a kilo, but ... 700.

27
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,040
Wonderful trout!

28
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,080
There's some fight left in it.

29
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,920
Now it's starting to run down.

30
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Look at this beautiful trout!
It's dinner today, Foss.

31
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,480
It weighs 1.2 kg.

32
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,480
Now I stand facing a classic choice
canoers face on the Great Lakes.

33
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm going over there. 
It's a mile of open water.

34
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,160
I can hit waves that have been
moving from the south for seven miles.

35
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,840
The waves can be large even if
I don't see foam tops from here.

36
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,040
I can get them from the side, and
they can ripple into the boat.

37
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,360
One may want
to wait until evening.

38
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,520
Then, waves are smaller as a rule.

39
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,200
But you can also put on the skirt.

40
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,520
This prevents the waves
and the water lapping into the canoe.

41
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,960
We are now across.
There's even a sandy beach.

42
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,160
I think there's a campground here.

43
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,680
There, we slipped nicely and neatly
into calmer waters.

44
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,000
The week on Lake Inari has
been excellent.

45
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,920
Not least, we finish with
water that's completely calm.

46
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,480
Beautiful paddle over. But there's something
that lures behind the hill down there.

47
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,560
It's only a few kilometers away.
There ends Lake Inari in the north.

48
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,760
I''ll go
into the Vatsari wilderness area.

49
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,600
Finns refer to it as the most
inaccessible wilderness of Finland.

50
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,520
Such things are tempting for me.
I have to go in there.

51
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,800
With the canoe and the dog and everything.
In a countercurrent to begin with.

52
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,800
The alternative is to carry,
but it's usually five twists.

53
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,840
This goes much faster.
It does not require more energy -

54
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:08,360
- if you do it steadily
  and are careful where you go.

55
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,480
Now only small
currents again, so we are up there.

56
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,640
There's a nice size to it.
It smells of kilogram fish.

57
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,880
The question: just what kind?

58
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,640
These are pike.

59
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,480
Another, much larger pike
follows the one on the hook.

60
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,480
We'll release it into the water
hoping that we get something else.

61
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,800
Trout and char, they'll work.
Parr's good, too.

62
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,440
We have begun to be picky.

63
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,720
Oh, good boy!
The first time you've crossed alone.

64
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,640
It's quite important
that he dares to do it.

65
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,200
Oh, good boy!

66
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,120
You were so good, Foss.
It turned out well, there.

67
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,520
When the dog can cross the river,
I can stop worrying about it -

68
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,760
- when there are many narrow passages
  with drawing the canoe and paddling.

69
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,000
Then it's better that
the dog runs along the shore.

70
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,400
We will wade up here too.

71
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,000
But sometimes I fish the pools
before stomping around in them, -

72
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,840
- and it pays off now. This is a
  wonderful trout we must get on board.

73
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,280
No, it escaped!

74
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,360
You went out there and swim back now?

75
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,840
Clearly a  Canada-dog, this.

76
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,120
It was great to paddle on Lake Inari,
but once I am here, -

77
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,600
- comes the real wilderness feeling.

78
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:23,200
Waves alone, no marked trails,
no roads, no cars, no people.

79
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,760
Only the dog, the canoe and I
and a river we fish for dinner in.

80
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,800
Like this.
There are lots of them.

81
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,120
No!

82
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,280
Is it gone now?

83
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,920
I had just turned up the tent.

84
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,640
Here's something I'm glad I have now,
though I'm an old bonfirer, -

85
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,320
- and that's the gas appliance.

86
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,360
The terrain of scree
is typical of Vatsari.

87
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
The area is 1550 square kilometers.

88
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,080
This is bigger
than Børgefjell National Park.

89
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Boulders make it difficult
to travel here on foot.

90
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,280
It's considerably easier with the canoe,
although I have to leave it downstream.

91
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,240
If one is walking, one must
have strong ankles and sturdy footwear.

92
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
You must be accustomed to wild life.

93
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,840
I have come far up the river,
it's easy to see.

94
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,640
The main river's
one and a half feet wide.

95
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,920
Then it becomes a lot of scree,
a disappearing stream.

96
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,360
It gets narrower and narrower.

97
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,160
Here we must begin to bear.

98
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,640
One should inspect the canoe sometimes
to see if there's a hole somewhere.

99
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,240
Here are a few leaks
which must be sealed.

99
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,540
(learn to pack a canoe at nrk.no/monsen)

100
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
Wonderful!
Now I come to Surnujärvi.

101
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I've had the greatest fishing trip.

102
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,700
I have taken enough.
I need to paddle to shore.

103
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,240
It vanished.
Like smoke.

104
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,240
It was huge, I mean.

105
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,160
I just saw a giant swirl -

106
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,880
- then it spun with its tail
  and said goodbye.

107
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,920
It may have been
between three and five kilograms.

108
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,120
Yes, yes.
That's it.

109
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
Just grit your teeth.

110
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,520
I've got dinner today,
but I was sad.

111
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,160
Now we spent an hour
for one kilometer as the crow flies.

112
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,960
Huge are the fish in the lake.

113
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,600
Have not had coffee before a fish bites.
Yesterday it was completely dead.

114
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,880
Typical char behavior.
It seemed totally totally dead.

115
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,400
Oi, it's trout.
Wonderful trout.

116
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,960
Oi, oi, oi, for a nice fish!

117
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,080
It jumped when it saw you, Foss.

118
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,520
Have you ever seen!
And so beautiful.

119
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,600
It's the most picturesque trout
I've ever had.

120
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,840
One and a half kilo, at least.
Managed to shoulder a nice fish!

121
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,080
Look at it, then!

122
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,880
It's 1.7kg. A late Saturday night
might sneak it over 2 also.

123
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,240
It's useless to fish and just 
stand there, really use the rod.

124
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,480
When it's so quiet on the water,
this is a good solution.

125
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:07,120
A float with a hole clean through.
No lead, only worms.

126
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,280
When the fish snatches a worm,
there's no resistance.

127
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,400
The leader runs through the float.
Had it been solid lead shot here, -

128
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,280
- the big fish will 
  become suspicious.

129
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,960
Where you can experience things this big
in a small pond?

130
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,440
It takes me five minutes
to walk around it.

131
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,840
There are signs
of pristine wilderness.

132
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,840
That's where a few people
and fish can live in peace.

133
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,320
That's where it's full.
It's a beautiful delicacy, -

134
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,800
- if only there were toast.

135
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,920
A wonderful diversion. There are
different delicacies than mackerel in tomato.

136
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,520
Pleasant visit in the morning,
litttle løvskrika.

137
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,280
It has a nose for food.

138
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,080
Especially for grayling
I've seen it eat.

139
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,360
Fly away with a belly full.

140
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,640
Fish waste can be spread in the trees
and bushes around the camp.

141
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,480
It's good food sense.

142
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,640
Go ahead, it's to you.
Now you need to eat.

143
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,840
An angry mink.

144
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,240
It has no retreat
and feels trapped.

145
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,760
It's angry, so we have to watch it.
The biting's guaranteed.

146
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,880
We'll let him alone, Foss.

147
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,760
Oh, good boy!

148
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,320
I have carried the canoe
down to Porojaure.

149
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,360
I'm on the river
which is 'Munk' river on the Norwegian side.

150
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,840
'Uutuanjoki' in Finnish.
Here we begin to get more water.

151
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,040
It's not entirely pure in style,
but we come down.

152
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,240
About five days til this trip's over.

153
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
And the whole project is over.

154
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,560
I try not to think about it,
but enjoy the moment while I have it.

155
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,160
I have already
taken a kilo pike.

156
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,480
Got Foss' name on that one,
and "Lars" on this.

157
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,720
Now you must try to approach your country.

158
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,040
It still has power.

159
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,560
This I will have up.

160
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,080
Come on, then!
Shall we try?

161
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,960
Won't you do it?

162
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,640
There's space here.
Come on.

163
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,680
I have driven it for ten minutes.

164
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,880
Dinner!
Beautiful fish, etc.

165
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,280
Good boy!

166
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,440
Gone well, but home's the best.
It's wonderful to be in Norway again.

167
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Now it's autumn again. I've
been through the four seasons.

168
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,320
From the autumn of last year, with the first
snow, and ever shorter days, -

169
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,440
- I knew I would
  be on tour throughout the winter.

170
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,760
Then came spring.
I was there when the ice broke up.

171
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,360
I was there
when the birds began to chirp.

172
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,960
It gives pleasure to see the changing face
of nature through all the seasons.

173
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:40,480
I am enormously grateful
to have experienced all this.

174
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,840
Not least that I have
experienced it at home in Scandinavia.

175
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:52,560
One need not go to Alaska or 
Canada to experience pristine wilderness.

176
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,640
One gets the feeling
of being completely alone in solitude -

177
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,240
- and the silence of the woods
  and the mountains we have here at home.

178
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,480
It's about going after the dream
and taking that step fully.

179
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,120
All the trips I have undertaken,
make it very clear.

180
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,080
One must decide
and make it known in good time.

181
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,960
Most people are prevented
by job and family.

182
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,200
The civilized carousel
we know all too well.

183
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:36,920
But announce it two years in advance to
family, employer and yourself.

184
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,240
Start planning.

185
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,200
Say that in August in two years
are you on an expedition in the wild.

186
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,800
I get paid for our toil!

187
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,800
We show off the trophy.

188
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,840
Can I hold it?   -Okay, thanks! Bye!

189
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,700
It was a wolf!

190
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Got fired by Santa Claus?

190
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,480
Any good children here?  -Yes, one...

191
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,720
The cold has settled like a lid over the landscape.

192
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,040
Hip, hurray in the mountains!

193
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,880
Thank you for showing up.

195
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,290
